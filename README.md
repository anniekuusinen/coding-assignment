# About the application

A simple React application that displays a list of users fetched from an API. The application allows users to search for specific users by name or their other information such as phone, website, address, email. Additionally, the list of users can be sorted by name or email in either ascending or descending order.

## Features
User List: Fetches and displays a list of users from an external API.
Search: Allows users to search by name, phone number, or address.
Sorting: Users can sort the list by name or email in ascending or descending order.

## How to run the application

Clone the repository. Then in the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Observation
The application can be improved further by fixing the sort as the input is typed in the search box. Implementing this takes more time than the given time limit for the assignment, so I decided to put it to retrospective.
